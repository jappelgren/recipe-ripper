# Recipe Ripper

A quick app I made to rip recipes from the web and convert them to a simple to markdown file. Get's around certain light paywalls like Bon Apetit. Does not work with sites that have hard paywalls like America's Test Kitchen.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. Create an output folder in the root of the project
4. `npm run start <url(s) of recipe you wish to rip>` - Can handle multiple recipes in one command, separate urls with a space.

## Known Working Sites

The following sites have been tested with the tool and yield a result

- Bon Apetit
- Food and Wine
- Saveur
- Serious Eats
- Various Little Food Blogs
